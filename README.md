This project is a demo for buidling your Django App in a docker container.

In this I have created three files for docker:
1 -> Dockerfile - contain the steps
2 -> docker-compose.yml - to add services like web services
3 --> requirements.txt - which contains all the requirements we want into our app

To build Image use :
docker-compose build

To activate the Docker:
docker-compose up
